## [2026-02-18] — Environment Simplification

### Change
- Removed three-stage deployment lifecycle (local → VPS Staging → VPS Production).
- Project now operates as a **single local environment** on macOS (ARM64).
- Updated `PRODUCT_LEDGER.md` to reflect this change.
- Committed `test_kimi_reasoning.py` as a dev utility for latency benchmarking.

---

## [2026-02-18] — Initial MVP Setup

### Environment
- Installed Python 3.12 (via Homebrew) and `uv` for dependency management.
- Cloned `HKUDS/nanobot` repository and installed in editable mode (`uv pip install -e .`).
- Ran `nanobot onboard` to initialize `~/.nanobot/config.json`.

### Model Configuration
- Configured **Nvidia NIM** as the LLM provider via the `openai` provider block.
  - `apiBase`: `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1`
  - Model: `openai/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5-instant` (instant/non-reasoning mode)
- Configured **Brave Search** for real-time internet access.

### Channels
- Enabled **Telegram** channel (`@Adams_Tech_ClawdBot`) in `config.json`.
- Verified `nanobot gateway` starts successfully with Telegram polling active.

### Skills Added
- **`telegram_notify`** (`nanobot/skills/telegram_notify/`)
  - `SKILL.md`: Skill definition for sending proactive Telegram messages.
  - `notify.py`: Helper script that reads token from `config.json` and sends a message to a given chat ID.

## [2026-02-18] — Kimi k2.5 Instant Mode Optimization

### Problem
- Default Kimi k2.5 response time was ~32 seconds due to internal "thinking" (reasoning) mode being enabled by default.

### Solution
- Added `model_overrides` to the `openai` provider spec in `nanobot/providers/registry.py`:
  - `kimi-k2.5-instant` → sends `extra_body: {thinking: {type: disabled}}` to disable reasoning, reducing latency to ~3s.
  - `kimi-k2.5` → keeps `temperature: 1.0` as required by the API.
- Updated `~/.nanobot/config.json` default model to `openai/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5-instant`.

### Bug Fix
- Fixed model resolution conflict: the `openai/` prefix was bypassing provider-specific overrides. Added `openai/` to `skip_prefixes` in the `moonshot` provider spec.
- Added `loguru` import to `litellm_provider.py` (was missing).
- Switched project to **editable install** (`uv pip install -e .`) so local source changes take effect immediately without reinstalling.

#### Technical Implementation

**Backend (server.py):**
- FastAPI-based REST API
- CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
- Static file serving for HTML/CSS/JS
- API endpoints:
  - GET/POST/PUT/DELETE for bookmarks
  - GET/POST for chat
  - GET for tasks
  - GET for schedule
  - GET for topology data
- Data stored in JSON files under ~/.nanobot/workspace/dashboard/data/
- Auto-initialization of empty data files

**Frontend (index.html + script.js + style.css):**
- Responsive glass-morphism design
- Aurora gradient background
- Tab-based navigation
- Modal dialogs for forms
- Live clock updates
- Activity logging
- Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to send, Ctrl+R to refresh)
- Drag-and-drop file upload zone
- Empty state handling
- Mobile-responsive layout

**Data Storage:**
- bookmarks.json: Bookmark array with id, title, url, folder, tags, created
- chat.json: Message array with role, message, timestamp
- tasks.json: Task array with name, status, created, id
- schedule.json: Reminder array with title, date, type, id

**Topology Scanning Algorithm:**
- Auto-scans ~/.nanobot/skills/ directory for SKILL.md files
- Reads config.json for enabled channels and providers
- Builds dynamic node graph with 4 categories
- Radial layout algorithm with 90deg sector per category
- Central Nanobot node connected to all periphery nodes

### Commands
```bash
# Start dashboard (default: http://0.0.0.0:18790/dashboard)
nanobot dashboard

# Custom port
nanobot dashboard --port 8080

# Custom host
nanobot dashboard --host 127.0.0.1
```

### File Locations
- **Skill**: nanobot/skills/dashboard/
- **Templates**: nanobot/skills/dashboard/templates/
- **Live Dashboard**: ~/.nanobot/workspace/dashboard/
- **Data**: ~/.nanobot/workspace/dashboard/data/
- **Config**: ~/.nanobot/config.json (for topology scanning)

### Dependencies
- fastapi
- uvicorn
- pydantic

### Installation
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
# or
uv pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

### Testing
- Verified tab switching functionality
- Bookmark CRUD operations tested
- Topology scanning confirmed working
- File uploads functional
- Chat interface operational
- Mobile responsiveness validated

### Known Issues
- Current dashboard running on ports 18789-18792 (Node.js) needs restart
- Migrate from existing dashboard to new FastAPI-based version

### Next Steps
1. Restart existing dashboard process
2. Start new dashboard: `nanobot dashboard`
3. Access at http://localhost:18790/dashboard
4. Verify all 6 tabs functional
5. Add initial bookmarks
6. Test file upload
7. Verify topology auto-updates when new skills added
